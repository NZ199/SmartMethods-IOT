# Task 2
## Connecting two controllers together
This task demonstrates how to connect two Arduino controllers together using the I2C communication protocol in Tinkercad. The first controller reads the state of a push button and sends it to the second controller, which controls an LED based on the received value.
### Hardware Requirements
To complete this task, you will need the following components:
- 2 x Arduino UNO boards
- 1 x Push button
- 1 x LED
- 2 x 220-ohm resistors
- Jumper wires

### Software Requirements
To complete this task, you will need access to the Tinkercad online simulation platform.
